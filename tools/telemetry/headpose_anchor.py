"""headpose_anchor.py -- an INDEPENDENT (non-self-referential) orientation anchor for the
G2 controller optical pose stream, derived from the recorded SLAM HMD head pose.

WHY (the self-reference problem this fixes)
-------------------------------------------
The cleaned-GT de-flipper (deflip.py) resolves mirror-twin flips with two cues that both
live INSIDE the controller stream: the controller accelerometer gravity-tilt and temporal
continuity of the controller track itself. That is self-referential: a flip the de-flipper
misses pollutes BOTH the reference and the candidate, so the wrong-branch fraction is only a
lower bound, and a PURE-YAW flip (gravity-invariant) is unvalidatable by tilt alone.

The recorded `head_pose.bin` is a SLAM-derived HMD world pose, produced INDEPENDENTLY of the
controller LED stream (the SLAM tracker never sees the controller blobs). Its world frame is
gravity-aligned (verified: head IMU specific force rotated to world aligns with the vertical
axis to <8 deg median) and its YAW does NOT drift (SLAM closes the loop on the room, unlike a
free-running gyro). So it provides two anchors the in-stream cues cannot:

  * TILT  -- world-down is a real, SLAM-validated constant. A controller orientation whose
    body-gravity (from the controller accel, where static) does not rotate to world-down is on
    the wrong tilt branch. (This is the same gravity cue deflip uses, but with the world-down
    direction now independently CONFIRMED by SLAM rather than merely asserted.)
  * YAW   -- the controller's world heading measured RELATIVE TO THE HEAD heading. Because the
    head heading is non-drifting and independent of the controller, a sustained controller
    yaw-flip (which fools deflip's temporal continuity -- both sides of a long bad run agree
    with each other) stands out as a ~180 deg step against a robust head-relative yaw track.

FUSION (do not replace -- abstain on disagreement)
--------------------------------------------------
This anchor does NOT replace the controller-accel cue; it is fused with it:
  * tilt: the anchor and the accel cue share the gravity physics, so they agree by
    construction where both are available; the anchor's contribution is to extend the verdict
    to MOVING frames (world-down is constant; it needs no static window) by carrying the last
    static body-gravity forward only over short gaps.
  * yaw: a verdict the accel cue simply cannot produce.
A per-frame branch verdict is GOOD / TILT_FLIP / YAW_FLIP / ABSTAIN. ABSTAIN is emitted when
the two cues disagree, or when neither has an observable opinion (gravity unobservable AND the
head-relative yaw track is itself uncertain there) -- honest abstention, never a false call.

This module is the C1 deliverable. It exposes:
  load_head_pose(d, m)               -> HeadPose (stale warm-up rows dropped)
  headpose_anchor_device(...)        -> AnchorResult (pure arrays; unit-testable)
  anchor_from_capture(d, dev)        -> AnchorResult bound to a real capture
  deflipper_miss_rate(d, dev)        -> the de-flipper's measured miss-rate vs this anchor
Run standalone for a per-controller anchor + de-flipper trust-bound report.
